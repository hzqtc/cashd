## üöß Limitations

The following limitations are known:

- Only supports `Cash`, `Bank Account` and `Credit Card` as account types
- Only supports `$` as the currency
- Specficially for `ledger` transactions
  - Only supports 2 postings per transaction

### üìä Supported Data Sources

`cashd` is designed to be flexible with your financial data. Currently, it supports:

- **CSV Files:** Load transactions from a standard CSV file. `cashd` provides extensive configuration options to correctly parse your CSV data.
- **Ledger/Hledger:** Integrate seamlessly with popular plain-text accounting tools like `ledger` and `hledger` by parsing their journal files.
  - Note: `cashd` invokes `ledger print` or `hledger print` and does not read journal files directly

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequsites

- A nerd font enabled terminal
- (Optional) ledger or hledger

### üì¶ Prebuilt binary

Prebuilt binaries can be downloaded from the [release page](https://github.com/hzqtc/cashd/releases).

Or using [eget](https://github.com/zyedidia/eget)

```bash
eget hzqtc/cashd
```

### üèóÔ∏è Build from source

To build `cashd`, ensure you have Go installed (version 1.18 or higher).

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cashd.git
    cd cashd
    ```
2.  **Build the application:**
    ```bash
    make
    ```
3.  **Installs binary to `~/.local/bin`:**
    ```bash
    make install
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

### üìñ Loading Data from Ledger/Hledger (default)

To load transactions from a Ledger or Hledger journal file, use the `--ledger` flag:

```bash
cashd --ledger path/to/your/journal.dat
```

Alternatively, you can set the `LEDGER_FILE` or `HLEDGER_FILE` environment variables:

```bash
export LEDGER_FILE=/path/to/your/journal.dat
cashd
```

### üìÇ Loading Data from a CSV File

To load transactions from a CSV file, use the `--csv` flag and `--csv-config` flag:

```bash
cashd --csv path/to/your/transactions.csv --csv-config path/to/your/config.json
```

### üß™ Generating a Sample CSV File

The `sample` directory contains `sample.csv` and `sample-csv-config.json` for testing.

```bash
cashd --csv sample/sample.csv --csv-config sample/sample-csv-config.json
```

### Search Syntax

Searching the transactions is easy by pressing `/` key from transactions view.
By default, cashd matches each keyword individually in all transaction fields.
Use keyword prefix to specify field for matching"

- `d:` match transaction Date, also supports `>` and `<` operators
  - For example, `d:2020-04-05`, or `d:>2020 d:<2023`
- `t:` match transaction Type
- `a:` match transaction Account
- `c:` match transaction Category
- `m:` match transaction Amount, also supports `>` and `<` operators
  - For example, `m:600`, or `m:>2000 m:<2500`
- `p:` match transaction Description

> [!NOTE]
> All keywords are combined using `AND` logic, meaning a transaction must match all keywords to show in search results.

#### Negative keywords

A keyword can be turned into negative keyword by adding `-` prefix.
`-` can be combined with other keyword prefixes to perform complex search queries, for examples:

- `m:>4999 t:expense -c:loan -c:tax`: find expenses that are more than $4999 and not in loan or tax categories
- `t:income -c:salary m:>1999`: find income transactions that are more than $1999 and not from salary

### üíª Command Line Flags

- `-h`, `--help`: Show help message.
- `--csv <file_path>`: Specify the path to your CSV transaction file.
- `--csv-config <file_path>`: Specify the path to your CSV configuration JSON file.
- `--ledger <file_path>`: Specify the path to your Ledger/Hledger journal file.
- `--hide-help`: Hide in-app help panel

## ‚öôÔ∏è CSV Configuration File Format

The CSV configuration file is a JSON file that defines how `cashd` should parse your CSV data.
This is particularly useful if your CSV columns or data formats differ from the default expectations.

Here's an example of the structure:

```json
{
  "columns": {
    "Period": "Date",
    "Accounts": "Account",
    "Category": "Category",
    "Note": "Description",
    "USD": "Amount",
    "Income/Expense": "Type"
  },
  "date_formats": [
    "2006-01-02",
    "2006-01-02 15:04:05",
    "01/02/2006",
    "01/02/2006 15:04:05"
  ],
  "transaction_types": {
    "income": "Income",
    "inc.": "Income",
    "expense": "Expense",
    "exp.": "Expense",
    "exps.": "Expense"
  },
  "account_types": {
    "cash": "Cash",
    "bank": "Bank Account",
    "credit card": "Credit Card"
  },
  "account_type_from_name": {
    "^cash$": "Cash",
    "checking$": "Bank Account",
    "saving(s)?$": "Bank Account",
    "card$": "Credit Card"
  }
}
```

### üìù Config Fields:

- `columns`: A map where keys are the actual column headers in your CSV file, and values are the corresponding internal `TransactionField` names (`Date`, `Type`, `AccountType`, `Account`, `Category`, `Amount`, `Description`).
- `column_indexes` (Optional): A map where keys are `TransactionField` names and values are the 0-based index of the column in your CSV. If not provided, `cashd` will attempt to infer column indexes from the `columns` mapping and the CSV header.
- `date_formats`: An array of Go time format strings that `cashd` will attempt to use when parsing the `Date` column. The first format that successfully parses the date will be used.
- `transaction_types`: A map where keys are string values found in your CSV's "Type" column, and values are the internal `TransactionType` (`Income` or `Expense`). This allows `cashd` to understand various representations of income and expense in your data.
- `account_types`: A map where keys are string values found in your CSV's "AccountType" column, and values are the internal `AccountType` (`Cash`, `Bank Account`, `Credit Card`).
- `account_type_from_name`: A map where keys are regular expressions that will be matched against the `Account` name (case-insensitive), and values are the `AccountType` to assign if a match is found. This is useful for inferring account types when they are not explicitly provided in your CSV. If no match is found, it defaults to `Credit Card`.
